Caesar cipher encrypt or decrypt using python

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. Itâ€™s a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:

A â†’ D

B â†’ E

C â†’ F

â€¦

X â†’ A

Y â†’ B

Z â†’ C

So, the word HELLO becomes KHOOR with a shift of 3.

Key points:

Invented by Julius Caesar (hence the name), who used it to protect military messages.

The "key" is the number of positions you shift the alphabet (e.g., 3).

It is easy to implement but also easy to break (just try all 25 possible shifts).

ðŸ‘‰ Itâ€™s mainly of historical interest today, since modern encryption methods are far more secure.
